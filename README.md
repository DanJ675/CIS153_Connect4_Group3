This is a 2 player connect-4 game where you can choose either two players or play against the computer, new players can be added on the home screen and all player data is persistent. The AI has the following rules: if it can win, if it can block a win, if it can connect 3 in a row, block 2 in a row, etc. Hover in the yellow space above the column to see your move, then click to place. All modes save to the player stats and can be viewed on the stats page.
